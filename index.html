    <p>A hobby is an activity that is done regularly mostly in the free time and it is done for enjoyment. We all have some hobbies like singing, dancing, cooking, listening to music, etc. My hobby is drawing.I love to draw since I was four years old. I used to scribble on the walls and make some easy caricatures using a pencil. I made cats, cartoons, flowers, etc. My mother realized that it is my hobby and she sent me to a drawing teacher to take drawing classes during summer vacations.I have also improved over the years. Earlier, I used to draw the only objects but now I can draw scenery too. I have won many certificates and prizes in the drawing. I would like to be an artist one day. In the end, I would like to say that hobbies are very important. We all should have one. </p>
